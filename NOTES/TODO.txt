    X add a timestamp column to the example item table
    X add a constraint to the price column so that it stores only 2 decimal
        places
    X add a UUID column to the example item table
    X add proper try/catches and status code returns for non-200 conditions
    X decompose routers
    X put pydantic models in their own file
    X put "items" CRUD into a repo (if we want this template to be
        opinionated about architecture)
    - add tests
    - maybe: add a redis caching example
    - maybe: add pre-commit hooks
    - maybe: use a fastapi basesettings subclass for the app settings definition
    - maybe: add migrations with Alembic or similar
